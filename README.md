# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: runner is renamed to runa

This crate has been **renamed** to [`runa`](https://crates.io/crates/runa-tui).  
The repository remains at [https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa](https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa)

runa supports legacy configuration at `$HOME/.config/runner/runner.toml`.
The default config path for runa-tui will be `$HOME/.config/runa/runa.toml` in future releases.

**Reason for rename:**  
The original name `runner` could cause confusion with GitHub Action runners, code runners, and other general "runner" terminology.  
The new name is `runa` while the CLI binary still being `rn`.

### Installation (new):

```bash
cargo install runa-tui
```


# `runner` (DEPRECATED)

## Changelog

For a detailed list of changes and release notes, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

Installation via cargo:

```bash
cargo install runner-tui
```

### Build from source

Clone the repo and build with Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexm-dev/runner.git
cd runner
cargo build --release
```

### Usage

Run runner with:
`rn`

## Configuration

A full configuration documentation will follow.  

runner uses a runner.toml file for configuration.
By default, it is located at:

`$HOME/.config/runner/runner.toml` (on both Unix and Windows, inside the user folder)

You can override the config path by setting an environment variable:

```bash
# Unix
export RUNNER_CONFIG=/path/to/runner.toml

# PowerShell (Windows)
$env:RUNNER_CONFIG="C:\path\to\runner.toml"
```

You can generate a default config using the --init or --init-minimal flag:

```bash
rn --init

# For a very minimal config
rn --init-minimal
```

This will generate a config in the default config path.

## Roadmap

runner is in active development.  
Future releases will focus on expanding functionality while keeping it fast and lightweight.
