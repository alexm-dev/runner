# Changelog

## [0.5.1] - 2025-01-10

### Added
- **bat integration**: Added `bat` as an preview option to the internal preview. Can be set in `runa.toml` under `[display.preview_options]`
- **Clear Markers/Filters**: Added a `clear_filters` and `clear_markers` keybind option to clear either.
- **Icons**: Added optional nerd font icons. Is desabled by default.

### Fixed
- **Parent pane**: Fixed the parent pane stale content update **and** optimized the parent directory selection being reset and redrawn after every directory change.
- **Directory Marker**: Fixed the `dir_marker` option to toggle the `/` for all panes.

### Changed
- **fd exclusions**: Switched to using a central exclusion map for `fd` searches. Added multiple default directories (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `target`, `venv`, etc.) to reduce noise and improve relevance when searching. This also makes it easier to maintain and update the exclusion list.

### Internal
- **Core refactor**: Moved `formatter.rs` from utils/ to core/, since formatter now handles all core formatting logic of multiple functions.
- **Renamed file_manager.rs**: `file_manager.rs` is renamed to `rm.rs` to keep it more simple :)
- **Renamed find**: `find.rs` is renamed to `proc.rs` since it now handles all subprocesses spawned by runa.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-08

UI related additions and more.

### Added
- **Marker coloring**: Added a new `clipboard` config option to color the yanked and selected entries with a different marker color. Now its easier to indicate which entry was yanked.
- **Pane markers**: Added markers to panes. Now persistent markers will be shown/rendered in each preview and parent pane.
- **Toggle Marker jump**: Added `toggle_marker_jump` configuration option to theme.display to toggle if multiselect should jump to the first entry when the selection is at the last entry.
- **Instant Preview**: Added `instant_preview` configuration option to toggle between instant preview (requesting previews on every selection change) and pending previews. Off by default.
- **Empty filter**: Added a `No results for this filter` message when a filter applied shows no entries.

### Breaking Changes
- The keys `selection_fg` / `selection_bg` from `[theme.preview]` / `[theme.parent]` are now replaced by `selection.fg` / `selection.bg` or `[theme.preview.selection]` / `[theme.parent.selection]`
    - **New keys**:
    ```toml
    [theme.preview]
    fg = "default"
    bg = "default"
    selection.fg = "default"
    selection.bg = "default"

    ## Sub tables:

    [theme.preview.selection]
    fg = "default"
    bg = "default"
    ```
- If you set the selection colors for each pane, then these changes are breaking changes for you config.

### Fixed
- **Directory copy**: Fixed directories being unable to be copied.
- **Filter preview update**: Fixed preview data not being cleared when a filter shows no entries.
- **Config defaults:** `RawConfig` now explicitly sets default values for all fields, ensuring core options like `dirs_first` and `show_hidden` are enabled when configuration is omitted.

### Internal
- **Find**: Optimization for the find feature. Now lists the results faster.
- **Cargo update**: Dependencies updated to patch crates.
- **Worker thread API**: Worker thread spawnm functions are now private functions since worker threads are now spawned through `Workers` struct.
- **Preview constants**: Moved preview byte size and line count checks to the top of `core/workers.rs` for better clarity and maintainability.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-06

New feature update: The fuzzy finder.

### Added
- **Find function**: Added a new (fuzzy) find function to quickly search your directories and files.
    - Note: This feature optionally leverages the external tool [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for high-performance recursive traversal.
- **Scrollable find results**: Added a scroll able find result list to the new find function to scroll through the results in the widget.
- **Persistent filters**: Made filters persist for each directory it is applied to.
- **Configurable maximum find results**: Added a new configuration to change the internal defaults for the new find function. (Internal default is 2000).
- **Internal themes**: Added internal themes which can be set in the `runa.toml` config.

### Fixed
- **Parent pane**: Fixed a stale parent content request after initial startup of runa.
- **Pane Requests**: Improved ID handling for pane requests, making request IDs more robust and reliable.

### Internal
- **Code file structure**: Refactored modules and sub-modules for better maintainability. In example: Moved **core** runa modules, like `file_manager`, `worker`, etc. into `core`.
- **Worker thread separation**: Separated worker threads to individual lines for better performance. FileOp, Nav, Find and IO have each their own worker now.
- **External binary detection**: Integrated which for graceful detection of the fd search backend, providing user notifications if the tool is missing.
- **Tests**: Added new `find` related tests.

## [0.3.10] - 2025-12-30

Quick configuration generation patch when `runa.toml` is generated with `rn --init-full`

### Fixed
- **Initial configuration**: Fixed full `runa.toml` initial config generation made by cli arg `rn --init-full`. Now generates the correct configuration and honors the internal defaults.

### Added
- **Path string**: Display `~` for the home directory at the top of the TUI instead of the full absolute path.

### Changed
- **Internal default colors**: Changed internal default colors of `border`, `selection`, `titles` and `directory`.
**show_hidden**: Enabled `show_hidden` by default and is set to enabled internally.
- **Parent Pane**: Removed root indicator `/` in the parent pane, since `path_str` handles that in `ui.rs`.


---


### Changed

## [0.3.8] - 2025-12-30

Quick integration test patch for a more robust testing of runa with `cargo test`.

### Internal
**Testing**: Improved error handling and sandboxing of `nav_tests`, `utils_tests`, `worker_tests`, and `ui_tests`


---


## [0.3.7] - 2025-12-30

Quick patch to fix the cli message to show the correct cli args.

- **Border shape**: Added border shapes to configuration. "square", "rounded" or "double".
- **Status line configuration**: Added status line configuration options.

### Changed
- Refactored dialog position logic for all widgets: Dialogs that use `TopLeft`, `TopRight`, or `Custom()` now appear a few rows lower in unified border mode so they never cover status or title lines

### Fixed
- **Input fields**: Input widgets now dynamically crop/scroll horizontally and keep the widget size during terminal resize.

### Internal
- **Theme/Config Consistency**: Dialog style, position, and size are now fully driven from theme/configuration.
- New `dialog_position_unified` and `adjusted_dialog_position` helpers to help with the widget drawing modes for each border mode.
- **Dependencies**: Added `humansize` and `chrono` crates for ShowInfo overlay widget.


---


## [0.3.5] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- **Preview Pane**: Resolved a race condition that caused a brief flash of old directory entries when rapidly navigating between folders immediately after startup.

### Internal
- **Allocation Optimization**: Optimized `tick()` in `app.rs` to pre-calculate the selected path, reducing the times `PathBuf` and string joins are done during the tick loop.


---


## [0.3.4] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Input polish**: Added cursor movement within input fields.
- **File collision**: Added `get_unused_path` to utils.rs. It now becomes `test_1.txt` instead of colliding.

### Fixed

### Internal
- **Hardened NavState**: Threw 1 million iterations at the navigation math. It’s rock solid now.
- **Refactoring**: Renamed `popup` to `dialog` across codebase for better naming. (Just feels better).

---



## [v0.2.8] - 2025-12-22
## Changed
- Updated Cargo release profiles in `Cargo.toml` for optimized builds.



---


## [v0.2.7] - 2025-12-22

---


## [v0.2.6] - 2025-12-22
### Fixed
- **File/Directory preview**: Fixed issue where preview did not correctly render when pane sizes where inconsistent. Now using `unicode-width` to correctly calculate pane width.
- **Pane ratios**: Pane ratios are now correctly calculated and will always internally calculate to 100%, meaning its not needed to always have 100% ratio in the runa.toml config.

### Added
- **Preview underline**: Toggle to enable a underline for the preview pane.
- **Directory colors**: Colors for directories are now independent of entry colors.

### Internal
- **Massive refactor**:  
    - Refactored `AppState` with modular app sub-modules: `app/nav.rs`, `app/parent.rs` and `app/preview.rs`
    - Refactored `Config` to make it more maintainable `config/themes`, `config/display`, `config/input`.
    - Separated UI functions from `terminal.rs` and added UI specific modules: `ui.rs`, `ui/panes.rs`, `ui/widgets.rs`
    - `worker.rs`: Ensured preview lines properly account for Unicode width and ignore control characters and tabs, preserving visual alignment in the TUI.
    - All worker responses and previews now produce strings of the exact pane_width, so TUI rendering remains stable regardless of file names or content length.

- **Tests**: Added formatting and worker tests

---

## [v0.2.5] - 2025-12-21
### Fixed
- **File Preview:** Fixed an issue where files without extensions and with very short names (≤ 3 characters, for example `ht`, `xy`) were incorrectly shown in the preview pane.
- **Preview Bleed/Race:** Hardened preview logic to ensure only the freshest preview request result is ever shown, preventing bleed from stale async worker responses during very fast navigation.

### Changed
- Reduced the default maximum number of previewed lines from 60 to 50 for better fit across a variety of terminal sizes. (Will make it configurable in following releases)
- Increased tick debounce from 15 to 75 milliseconds to reduce excessive preview requests during very fast navigation.

### Internal
- Improved worker-response by relying on request IDs to always honor the latest directory or preview pane update, eliminating edge cases with rapid async requests.
- Clarified and strengthened file preview and worker-response logic, including improved state handling and fewer UI edge case bugs.

---

## [v0.2.4] - 2025-12-20
### Changed
- Switched `always_show` config to use `HashSet<OsString>` for much faster and efficient lookups.
