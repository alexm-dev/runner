# Configuration

runner configuration is under active development and options may change over time.

## Default Configuration

Default configuration file can be generated with: `rn --init`

This will create a `runner.toml` with the following contents:

```toml
# Shows directories always before files
dirs_first = true

show_hidden = false

# Shows hidden system files (Mostly useful for windows)
show_system = false

[display]

# Shows the selection icon next to the file/directory name
show_selection_marker = true

# Shows the default '/' symbol next to the directory name
show_dir_marker = true

# Option to disable the border of runner
borders = true

# Theme section to customize runner (Will be expanded upon)
