A fast and lightweight console file browser written in Rust

**runa - rn** is a minimalist terminal file manager focused on speed and simplicity.  
It allows you to navigate directories, view file listings, and perform typical file browser actions.  

**runa** is very customizable, checkout the [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) docs for all the available options.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **runa** is a work in progress. It is being actively developed and features may change over time.

## Changelog
For a detailed list of changes and release notes, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

### Cargo:

```bash
cargo install runa-tui
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

You can install runa from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/runa) using an AUR helper like `paru` or `yay`:

```bash
yay -S runa
```

### Pre-compiled Binaries

If you'd like to download Pre-compiled binaries instead of isntalling runa as a crate in cargo or via the AUR,
you can grab the latest binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS form the [Release](https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa/releases) page.

After downloading, add the `rn` (Linux/macOS) or `rn.exe` (Windows) binary to your system `PATH` to use runa from your terminal.

> [!TIP]
> **Checksum Check:** You can verify the integrity of the release archives using the `SHA256SUMS.txt` file in the [Release](https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa/releases) page.
>
> Unix
> ```bash
> sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
> ```
> This checks all the checksums of the SHA256SUMS.txt.
> To check a specific release archive:
> ```bash
> grep runa-linux-x86_64.tar.gz SHA256SUMS.txt | sha256sum -c
> ```
>
> Windows
> ```powershell
> Get-FileHash runa-windows-x86_64.zip -Algorithm SHA256
> ```
> Compare the output with the corresponding entry in `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

### Build from source

Clone the repo and build with Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa.git
cd runa
cargo build --release
```

### Usage

Run runa with:
`rn`

## Configuration

A full configuration documentation will follow.  

runa uses a runa.toml file for configuration.
By default, it is located at:

`$HOME/.config/runa/runa.toml` (on both Unix and Windows, inside the user folder)

You can override the config path by setting an environment variable:

```bash
# Unix
export RUNA_CONFIG=/path/to/runa.toml

# PowerShell (Windows)
$env:RUNA_CONFIG="C:\path\to\runa.toml"
```

You can generate a default config using the --init or --init-minimal flag:

```bash
rn --init

# For the whole configuration options runa.toml
rn --init-full

# For help with all the configuration options.
rn --config-help
```

This will generate a config in the default config path.

## Roadmap

runa is in active development.  
Future releases will focus on expanding functionality while keeping it fast and lightweight.  

### Planned features

- [ ] Image Previews: Support for Sixel/Kitty graphics protocols.  

- [ ] Syntax Highlighting: Treesitter integration for the preview pane.  

### Completed
