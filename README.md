- **Extremely Customizable:** Every key, theme color, pane, and UI element can be adjusted in an easy TOML config.
- **Blazing Fast:** Instant navigation, even in large directories.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only uses essential Rust crates; advanced features (like fuzzy search) are fully optional.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Keyboard-Driven:** Every action accessible by keybinding. No mouse needed.

<summary><strong>Why is runa fast?</strong></summary>

- **Multi-threaded engine:** Spawns 4 dedicated worker threads (with `crossbeam_channel`) for I/O, preview, find, and file operations, so UI is never blocked.
- **Essential-only Rust crates:** No external TUI frameworks or bloat.
- **Direct terminal rendering:** Uses low-overhead [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) & [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm).
- **Optional blazing-fast find:** Integrates with [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for recursive fuzzy search.
- **Small, native binary:** The `rn` binary is compact (typically 1.4–2 MB, depending on operating system and architecture).

</details>

**runa - rn** is a minimalist terminal file manager focused on speed and simplicity.  
It allows you to navigate directories, view file listings, and perform typical file browser actions.  

**runa** is very customizable, checkout the [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) docs for all the available options.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **runa** is a work in progress. It is being actively developed and features may change over time.

## Changelog
For a detailed list of changes and release notes, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

### Cargo:

```bash
cargo install runa-tui
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

You can install runa from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/runa) using an AUR helper like `paru` or `yay`:

```bash
yay -S runa

# or for binaries through the AUR
yay -S runa-bin
```

### Pre-compiled Binaries

If you'd like to download Pre-compiled binaries instead of installing runa as a crate in cargo or via the AUR,
you can grab the latest binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS from the [Release](https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa/releases) page.

After downloading, add the `rn` (Linux/macOS) or `rn.exe` (Windows) binary to your system `PATH` to use runa from your terminal.

> [!TIP]
> **Checksum Check:** You can verify the integrity of the release archives using the `SHA256SUMS.txt` file in the [Release](https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa/releases) page.
>
> Unix
> ```bash
> sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
> ```
> This checks all the checksums of the SHA256SUMS.txt.
> To check a specific release archive:
> ```bash
> grep runa-linux-x86_64.tar.gz SHA256SUMS.txt | sha256sum -c
> ```
>
> Windows
> ```powershell
> Get-FileHash runa-windows-x86_64.zip -Algorithm SHA256
> ```
> Compare the output with the corresponding entry in `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

### Build from source

Clone the repo and build with Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexm-dev/runa.git
cd runa
cargo build --release
```

### Usage

After installation, start runa with: `rn`

> [!TIP]
> **Icons** (for files, folders, etc.) are disabled by default, but can be enabled in your `runa.toml`.  
> To display them correctly, use a **Nerd Font** or a patched font in your terminal.  
> Without a Nerd Font, icons may appear incorrectly and the UI may not render as intended.  

## Optional Enhancements

`runa` is designed to be lightweight and standalone. However, some advanced features leverage specialized external tools:

* **Fuzzy Search:** To enable fast, recursive fuzzy finding, install **[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)**.
  * If `fd` is detected in your `PATH`, the search feature will be enabled automatically.
  * Without it, `runa` remains a fully functional file manager but will notify you if you attempt a recursive search.

* **Preview Syntax coloring**: To enable syntax coloring in the preview pane, install **[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)**
  * If `bat` is detected and installed, you can switch method in the runa.toml to `method = "bat"`.
  * Without it, `runa` uses the `internal` preview method, which is a plain preview method useful for extra speed without syntax highlighting.

## Configuration

runa uses a runa.toml file for [configuration](docs/configuration.md).  
By default, it is located at:

`$HOME/.config/runa/runa.toml` (on both Unix and Windows, inside the user folder)

You can override the config path by setting an environment variable:

```bash
# Unix
export RUNA_CONFIG=/path/to/runa.toml

# PowerShell (Windows)
$env:RUNA_CONFIG="C:\path\to\runa.toml"
```

You can generate a default config using the --init or --init-minimal flag:

```bash
rn --init

# For the whole configuration options runa.toml
rn --init-full

# For help with all the configuration options.
rn --config-help
```

This will generate a config in the default config path.

## Roadmap

runa is in active development.  
Future releases will focus on expanding functionality while keeping it fast and lightweight.  

### Planned features

- [ ] Image Previews: Support for Sixel/Kitty graphics protocols.
